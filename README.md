# Deltona
A Public Repo To Develop a City Website. Just for fun.

I'm a lover of the City of Deltona. I'd like to create a fun space for it's citizens. Sure there are social networks, but none of those specialize in the super local interests, like Yard Sales, events at the Park, and other city news. This is a place for citizens to connect and interact with each other.
